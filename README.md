Simplicity meets precision with the minimalistic design of the website. Designed with a passion that I and my friend [AalokeCode](https://github.com/AalokeCode/) share for clean aesthetics and functional elegance, this website distills the weather data into a beautifully designed and accessible minimalistic interface. Stripping away unnecessary complexity, it provides users with essential weather updates in a straightforward manner.

## How It Works
- The website fetches the weather information from an API call
- Given a location from the search box, it will update the current webpage with the information from the API call.
